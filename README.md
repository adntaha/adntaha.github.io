# Aidan's personal website

This repository contains the source code for my personal site, hosted at [adntaha.github.io](https://adntaha.github.io).

## Tech stack

- **Framework:** [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- **Theme:** [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)
- **Hosting:** [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a true classic.

## Acknowledgments

This site would not be possible without the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme, created by Michael Rose.
