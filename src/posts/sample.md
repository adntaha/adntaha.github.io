"Dear applicant,  
  
Thank you for applying. Regrettably, we're writing to you to inform you that this position has been filled. We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors." Or so you read. It's the infinite cycle we're stuck in. One where a lack of work experience leads to rejection. Hi, I'm Aidan, and I've faced quite a few rejections.  
  
Do we really need to apply for internships? Not necessarily. There's an alternative path whose doors we can open ourselves: creating our own companies. It sounds intimidating, but is it really?  
  
We've all had "what if I had this" or "this would make it so much easier" moments. This first step, often referred to as ideation[^1], is the hardest part of starting a business. One you've got an idea, put financial matters aside for now and make a business proposal or just commit your ideas to ink. When you run into a wall, look for answers at your local library or on the Internet. In Canada, all it takes to incorporate–create a company that legally acts as its own person, its own entity—is $200, an address, and five minutes. I should know, I've founded one myself. Creating the company was the hardest yet easiest task, because it was a promise to myself to invest time and energy into it. Of course, taking care of a business needs more investment than just creating it, which you can learn as you go along. It took 6 months of part-time work by me and a friend to finally develop an app that was ready for the public, so don't be afraid of playing the long game.  
  
If that's all it takes, why aren't more people starting a business? Well, money. Acquiring funding. Of course, money's always been an issue, but it's gotten especially tougher after the financial market crash of 2008[^2]. Today, investors aren't looking for elaborate business plans, but for sales. As a Silicon Valley investor, Philip Cooke, stated, "sales fix everything."  
  
But you'd be surprised at how supportive some customers can be when it comes to budding companies once you find your target audience. Another issue that appears frequently is the knowledge of business law required. It's much simpler if your business is not its own legal entity, and you can consult a legal clinic at no cost to you for most of the other issues or questions that could arise.  
  
I'd ask that you take some time when you're free to reflect on this topic, and whether it would be something you'd appreciate more than working under a boss in the future. After all, statistics are cool but what matters is that you enjoy what you're doing, and you're more likely to be impactful with the right idea than in a day job. Why not give it a try?  
  
Regards,  
Aidan Taha
